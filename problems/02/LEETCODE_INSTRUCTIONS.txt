#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        

3. REPLACE the entire Solution class with the code from COPY_THIS_TO_LEETCODE.py
